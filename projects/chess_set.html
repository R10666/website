                    I did this project for fun over the summer as a way to learn 3D printing. I don't have the exact numbers but to print out the entire chess set it took somewhere about 120 hours, took me around a month to finally have everything printed and put together, this is not accounting for the design time that I took before. The entire set is printed out of my Creality s1 pro, for both black and white filament I used PETG since it's more durable and UV resistant than PLA as I planned to put it in my living room where it's pretty sunny.
                    <br>
                    I wanted to design a minimalistic style chess set that would also reflect each of the pieces in a not too abstract way such that when others use it they can still reasonably guess which piece is which. I didn't do this because I like the minimalism style, I just didn't want to do something too insane for my first print. 
                    <br>
                    I made sure to design the size and volume as well as complexity of each piece relevant to their respective worth(of points). For example, a pawn is worth 1 point thus it was the shortest and had the most simple shape. While the King was a more detailed Hexagon shape that towered over all the other pieces.

                    Overall very happy with how it all turned out, the jigsaw design of the board worked but could've had some better tolerance, it's not very noticeable and I would feel wasteful to print all 64 pieces of them again. One thing I didn't like was how light each piece was. I think a nice thing to have would be embedded magnets under each piece as well as centered under each of the jigsaw squares that made up the board. This would mean pieces would be heavier giving it a nicer feel, and pieces also would always sit in the middle of a square after being placed.
